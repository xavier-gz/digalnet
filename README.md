**Galnet Dictionary**

*Multilingual dictionary with translations and synonyms for 10 languages: Galician, Portuguese, Catalan, Basque, Spanish, English, German, Latin, Italian and Chinese. More than 750.000 words at your fingertips!*

The Galnet Dictionary is a Wordnet-based multilingual dictionary with translations and synonyms for 10 languages: Galician, Portuguese, Catalan, Basque, Spanish, English, German, Latin, Italian and Chinese (both Traditional and Simplified Chinese).

This multilingual dictionary contains the Galnet lexical database (http://sli.uvigo.gal/galnet/) which is being developed by the Computational Linguistics Group at the University of Vigo (http://sli.uvigo.gal) and is available from 2011.

The goal of the Galnet development is integrating the Galician language into the interlingual lexical-semantic network of WordNet (https://wordnet.princeton.edu), according the EuroWordNet model. Galnet is part of the Multilingual Central Repository (http://adimen.si.ehu.es/web/MCR) and the Open Multilingual Wordnet (http://compling.hss.ntu.edu.sg/iliomw/omw). Galnet contents can be searched with several web applications and can also be downloaded in RDF and LMF formats with a free license (http://sli.uvigo.gal/download/SLI_Galnet/).
